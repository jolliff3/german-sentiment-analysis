These results were generated with the following filters:
date_start = datetime(2021, 1, 1)
date_end = datetime(2023, 4, 30)
faction_id=Q42575708 (AfD)

The outputs were grouped by faction - Note that given the filters, this should mean that each report only has one row.

For each csv, you can see the time at which it was run in the name of the csv.
